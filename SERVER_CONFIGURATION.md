Server configuration:

Java8 until Java9 is stable: Ubuntu 16.04, 8 Core/12/32 Core/ 50gb to 1Tb, Http: Oddyssey-v2.0.8.1(Upgrades Stay Consistent).
Config File stays consistently updated accordingly to TRON Protocol.

8 (Eight) Apple macintosh based Mac Pro's all with 7 teraflops of computing power and 12gb GDDR5 VRams, Thermal Cores, and 802.11ac wi-fi connection capabilities. 

Processing powers: 8 core 3.9ghz each, equalling 64 core. Upscale of each Pro may and will be maxed at 12-32 each in expansion long term.

PLANS FOR HARDWARE EXPANSION

All hardwares are Apple Macintosh based Mac Pro's all with 7 teraflops of computing power and 12gb GDDR5 VRams, Thermal Cores, and 802.11ac wi-fi connection capabilities. 

Processing powers: 8/12/32 core 3.9ghz each.

Internet network speeds are at the highest peak performance that is currently allowable through business internet speed buildout and access.

Dual-system backup, which is a factor of stability and data security performance.

Expansion plans:

Multiple backup Apple Macintosh Mac Pro's for backup node runnings each with individual google cloud nodes built.
In addition to verifying the node, multiple full nodes can also be provided, which can provide better API services to others. 

Each individual hardware machine is running individual self sustaining cloud and or bare metal based nodes in-house.

Server location:

Multiple IP's (IPs also may vary at times besides mainnet witness based node)

Bare metal server buildout is located in private undisclosed locations to ensure security always upon further developments of the witness node buildouts and exchange datas upon the in-house machines.


Further in-house exchange buildout overview of back end coding functionality:

-Multicast data sending.
-ReTransmitters to talk with and ask the matching engine and generator.
-Secondary passive matching engine running the same code as core matching engine.
-State machine is maintained at a consistent clean and well tested standard of maintenance.

MATCHING: 

-8 threads with ingress thread: Needed to allocate and fan out with symbols going to different cores, then to be brought back together for publication.

Further DEX Exchange buildout overviews will be updated and released in publications.

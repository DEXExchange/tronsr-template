Sever configuration:

Java8 until Java9 is stable: Ubuntu 16.04, 8 Core/12/32 Core/ 50gb to 1Tb, Http: Oddyssey-v2.0.8.1(Upgrades Stay Consistent)
Config File stays consistently updated.

8 (Eight) Apple macintosh based Mac Pro's all with 7 teraflops of computing power and 12gb GDDR5 VRams, Thermal Cores, and 802.11ac wi-fi connection capabilities. 

Processing powers: 8 core 3.9ghz each, equalling 64 core. Upscale of each Pro may and will be maxed at 12-32 each in expansion long term.

PLANS FOR HARDWARE EXPANSION
All hardwares are Apple Macintosh based Mac Pro's all with 7 teraflops of computing power and 12gb GDDR5 VRams, Thermal Cores, and 802.11ac wi-fi connection capabilities. Processing powers: 8/12/32 core 3.9ghz each.
Internet network speeds are at the highest peak performance that is currently allowable through business internet speed buildout and access.
Dual-system backup, which is a factor of stability and data security performance.

Expansion plans:
Multiple backup Apple Macintosh Mac Pro's for backup node runnings each with individual google cloud nodes built.
In addition to verifying the node, multiple full nodes can also be provided, which can provide better API services to others. According to above criteria, the content submitted by candidates will be scored appropriately, with a maximum score of 1 point.
Each individual hardware machine is running individual self sustaining cloud and or bare metal based nodes in house.

Server location:
Multiple IP's (IPs also may vary at times besides mainnet witness based node)
Server buildout is located in Northampton, Massachusetts, United States, and in Huntington Massachusetts, United States.

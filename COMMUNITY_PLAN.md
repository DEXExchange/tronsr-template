Campaign Overview:
Guidance for Voters:
Executive Introduction and Participation Guide:
The way DEX Exchange for Super Representative, is running its campaign is as follows:
During SR candicacy and after being voted into SR position to begin producing blocks, allocations of block rewards in the following coordination will continusouly be commenced:
Participation:
Freeze Voters: Stake 60% Rewards.
SR candidate and block production rewards are issued out every 24 hours in the form of TRON (TRX). All voters stake 50% of all SR Rewards as TRX and 10% Remaining rewards pool is issued out to all voters in the form of DEXCoin (XDEX). Totalling 60% daily rewards staking return to all voters continuous support.
All Voters Must Remain In Voting Pool For Four(4) Six(6) Hour back to back periods to recieve SR Voters Pool Rewards, that is then calculated and allocated out to all voters wallets.
XDEX is then either Hodled by long term investors, utilized for the launch of the DEX Exchange platform for enabling its utility function for 50% off all trading fees, or for utility use of easy transitions of XDEX to other cryptocurrency types with universal sitewide pairing to all such listed "cryptocurrency types". Other recievers whom vote and recieve the XDEX may also short their holding position into the liquidation pool immediately for a 2:1 Ratio of TRX:XDEX. So for every one XDEX you stake from voting, you may spend back to DEX Exchange on its online ecosystem, Twitter P2P (PeerToPeer) DEX Exchange, or the Telegram P2P (PeerToPeer) DEX Exchange for 2 TRX in return. All shorted/liquidated XDEX will be then be forever burned to ensure valuation stability and long term growth and success abilities and further potentials. "Burning the DEXCoin (XDEX) lessens the total supply to then allow for increased rarity of the cryptocurrency".
The DEXCoin (XDEX) will be fully migrated from the begining TRC20, 0 Decimal rate type, to a full smart contract finalized version launched upon the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM) through its remix deployment outlet. This smart contract version will carry a secure back end solidity coding with an 8 (eight)(0.00000000) decimal rating.
